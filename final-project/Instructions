The repository contains a set of files needed to simulate the data in the paper
"A Structural Model of the Retail Market for Illicit Drugs" by Manolis Galenianos and 
Alessandro Gavazza (AER, Vol.107, No.3, March 2017).

The results of the simulation, plus a counterfactual of what would happen in the market 
in case matching efficiency exogenously raises, are contained in the .pdf file. 

To simulate the data of the paper and compute the counterfactual analysis, download the files 
of this folder and run "main.m".
